## Overview

### The challenge

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Frontend build tool
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) - For map
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework

### What I learned

This project was my first experience using **Vite** as a build tool, allowing me to work with a fast development server, efficient hot module replacement, and a simplified configuration workflow.

It was also my first time working with **Leaflet**, where I learned how to integrate interactive maps into a React application, manage map state, and update markers dynamically based on external data.

Additionally, I used the **Geo.IPify API** to fetch geolocation data from IP addresses, gaining experience in consuming third-party APIs, handling asynchronous data, and connecting API responses to UI updates.

Finally, I reinforced my existing knowledge of **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, focusing on component-based architecture and responsive, utility-first styling.
